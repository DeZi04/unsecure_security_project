# Insecure Security Project

The most unsecure security app

In this repository, you'll find two Spring applications. They try to achieve the same goals, but one of them is very insecure.
We tried to make Spring as insecure as possible, which wasn't that easy, as Spring ships with good defaults.

We implemented the following vulnerabilities:

- [Cross Site Scripting (XSS)](./xss.md)
- [SQL Injection](./sql-injection.md)

The vulnerabilities are explained in the linked documents above.
We've also written an explainer on [OWASP](./owasp.md).
